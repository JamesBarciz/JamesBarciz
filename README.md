Hello, my name is James Barciz and I am passionate about the world of Data; specifically, I am interested in data analytics, visualizations and machine learning.  Technically speaking, I have worked primarily with Python 3 and SQL.

Particular Python libraries with which I have experience perform tasks ranging from data analytics to application development.  Such libraries include: Pandas, Matplotlib, Numpy, Scikit-learn, Spacy, Flask and Tensorflow 2.0.  I have pinned two repositories below highlighting specifically, two applications I have created using Flask for various projects.
